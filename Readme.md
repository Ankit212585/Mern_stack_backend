API : 
APS stands for application programming interface. 
It is a set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact with another. 
APIs are used to define the methods for communication between different software components.

You all know this stuff already. Now lets take things to next level.


# So Far !!
-----------

You have been using APIs in their most basic format. 
You send a request to a server and it sends back a response. 
But APIs can do so much more than that. 
They can be used to create new APIs, to modify existing APIs, and to integrate APIs with other APIs.
Most of the time that you practise is just DATA PICKING from APIs or LOOP through the data but APIs can do so much more than that.
At a max level, you went through the basic of state management.

# Beyond random user and Github API

## Step 1: http methods

Master the http methods you should know the difference between GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH and OPTIONS. 
You should know when to use each method and what each method does. 
You should also know how to use these methods in your code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Step 2: Status code and request headers 

You should know what status codes are and what they mean. 
You should know how to handle different status code in your code. 
You should also know how to set request headers. 
You should know what headers are and what they do.
You should know how to set headers in your code. 
Learn things like:

- request headers
- request ip
- request user agent
- oath variable
- query parameters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Step 3: Response handling

You think you know how to handle responses. But do you know how to handle different type of responses? 
You should know how to handle JSON, XML, and other types of responses.
You should know how to handle different types of errors.
You should know how to handle different types of responses in your code. Learn things like:

- Response headers
- Response caching
- response compression (gzip, brotli, etc.)
- response cookies
- redirect handling
- handle images (jpeg, png, webp, svg, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


## Step 4: Authentication

You should know how to authenticate with APIs. 
You should know how to use different types of authentication methods.
You should know how to handle authentication in your code. Learn things like:

- Basic authentication
- Bearer token
- OAuth
- JWT
- API Keys
- cookies
- session
- token
- refresh token

## Step 5: Api rate limiting 

- Rate limiting 
- Throttling 
- Caching
- Circuit breaker 
- Backoff 
- Timeout 
- Error Handling
